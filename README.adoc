A buildstep wrapping any number of other buildsteps, controlling their execution based on a defined condition.

== Info

This plugin requires the
https://plugins.jenkins.io/token-macro/[TokenMacro Plugin] and theÂ 
https://plugins.jenkins.io/run-condition/[Run Condition Plugin] to be installed!

* Ever wanted to have more control whether a step should be executed or not?
* Want to reduce the number of jobs doing nearly the same thing?

Add a conditional buildstep which acts as a container.
It will allow you to define a condition controling the execution of the step(s).

== Conditions

There are multiple conditions one can choose of, these are all defined by the
https://plugins.jenkins.io/run-condition/[Run Condition Plugin]

Missing builder

If you're not able to add the builder of your choice within a
conditional build step (because it's not available within the dropdown),
then this is likely because the builder does not provide a
`@DataBoundConstructor` constructor and/or the Descriptor does not
extend `hudson.tasks.BuildStepDescriptor`.
For non programmers: the plugin you would like to use does not yet follow the newest Jenkins coding guidelines.
Without this, the conditional buildstep plugin is not able to work with it.

== Conditional step (single)

// TODO: Move https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=59507542 to the documentation

This build step allows you to select any build step and define a
condition to control whether the step should be executed.
For reasons why you might want to use this step, see
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=59507542[Why
use Conditional step (single)?]

== Conditional steps (multiple)

A _Conditional steps (multiple)_ container is able to contain any number
of any other buildsteps (e.g. Shell, Ant, Maven,...) and you can have
any number of 'Conditional Steps' containers, each configured with a
different condition.
